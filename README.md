# Dollar Conversion

Dollar Conversion accepts a dollar ($) amount and converts it to the appropriate
string representation.

For example, **$2523.04** becomes
**"Two thousand five hundred twenty-three and 04/100 dollars"**

To run, clone this repo and initialize with `npm init`.

Tests can be run with `npm test`.

Currently split between `main.js`, which formats the results of num parsing in
`numToEnglish.js` into dollar/cents amounts.

See `dev-log.md` for more details, development plan, and "pork" that I can add
in the future.
